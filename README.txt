Function Plotter
(version 1)

To plot mathematical functions with one variable.
It's possible to specify the max values of both X and Y axis. For example if given max value x = 10 then the function will be plotted on an axis with X ranging from -10 to 10
All operands must be explicit. For example 4*x. 4x is not supported yet
